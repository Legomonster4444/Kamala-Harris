      Kamala Harris is going to improve our education system by expanding
      technical education and career opportunities. She believes we should put
      less pressure on standardized testing, so students can perform at the best
      of their abilities. She acknowledges that teachers do not receive the
      appreciation they deserve, and has decided to improve teachers working
      conditions and give every teacher a $13,500 raise. Kamala Harris will push
      the College for All Act that makes all 4-year colleges and universities
      free to attend. She will invest in these colleges and universities so they
      still get the money the need to continue providing education. She will
      clear student loans as they are a burden that we carry.

      One of Kamala Harris' goals is to control inflation. A few ways she will
      do this is by reducing essential costs such as food and housing. She has
      decided to raise the minimum wage so everyone can have a better living
      standards. She is also going to build around 3 million houses in the next
      four years to accommodate our growing population.

      Kamala Harris believes in affordable healthcare for all, and will
      accomplish this goal by creating a healthcare insurance system where the
      government provides money for your health. Private health insurance
      companies can still offer their services, except everybody will have
      access to it through the government. She will reduce prescription drug
      costs.
